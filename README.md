Greetings! New folders will be added to this repo with the name of each one of the trello tags once they are completed. Inside every one of them there will be a readme.md file with a link to the requested documentation.
Here's also a link to my complete documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15FJ5YHhiw8ykqmSVzPD8usCSQ3cFLz2SWgxTml7gTJM/
I see that this way of organizing is somewhat chaotic, i will implement as soon as posible new folders representing each one of the weeks of the BFEDA dividing the tag folders, sorry for the inconveniences
